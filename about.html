        <p>Hello, my name is Tyler Moore and with the help of many people I made this template. I made it so it is super easy to update and so that it flows perfectly with my tutorials. Lots of love and hundreds of hours went into making it. I hope you love it as much as I do.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I wish you the best of luck with your business, enjoy the adventure.</p>
